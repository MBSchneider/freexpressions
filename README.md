A simple application to create orders for Freexpressions devices.  See it at [http://www.freexpressions.com/](http://www.freexpressions.com/)

## Functionality
This application integrates with paypal to allow orders of Freexpressions devices.  On the orders page, per unit price is calculated (along with discounts) and the information is sent to Paypa; to facilitate checkout.

### Code
Some of the new things I played with on this project were:
- Rails 4 (vs. Rails 3.x)
- RSpec
- Javascript testing with poltergeist
